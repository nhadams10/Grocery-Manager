# Grocery-Manager
My first Python repo!

Here I am trying to build a basic program which will allow me to input the recipes I want to cook this week and receive a grocery list as the output.

I have identified a few key pieces needed to make this work:
  1. A way to get input from the user on which recipes they want to cook
  2. Recipes, which are stored as dictionaries with the key being the ingredient name and the value being an integer amount
  3. A way to combine dictionaries into a single dictionary
  4. A way to output the final dictionary into a user friendly grocery list format

While I have completed the Python Codecademy course, this is my first independent project!
