# Grocery-Manager

**My first Python repo!**

Here I am building a basic program which will allow users to input the recipes they want to cook and receive a grocery list as the output.

*I have identified a few key pieces to make this work:*
  1. A way to get input from the user on which recipes they want to cook
  2. Recipes, which are stored as dictionaries with the key being the ingredient names and the value being an integer amount
  3. A way to combine dictionaries into a single dictionary
  4. A way to output the final dictionary into a user friendly grocery list format

While I have completed the Python Codecademy course, this is my first independent project. 

**Thanks for checking it out!**
